# Arrowhead and Diagonal-plus-rank-one Eigenvalue Solvers


## Notice

This is a major rewrite of the package with following features:
* works with Julia 1.5+
* uses multi-threading
* memory usage is improved

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ivanslapnicar/Arrowhead.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ivanslapnicar/Arrowhead.jl?branch=master)



## Basics

N.B. The latest master is obtained by
`pkg> add Arrowhead#master`.

Usage:

```
using Arrowhead
# Set the dimension
n=10
# Generate SymArrow
A=GenSymArrow(n,n)
# Compute the eigenvalue decomposition
E,Info=eigen(A)
# Extract eigenvalues
Λ=E.values
# Extract eigenvectors
U=E.vectors
```

For further examples see the file [runtests.jl](tests/runtests.jl).

The package contains functions for __forward stable__ algorithms which compute:
* all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a real symmetric arrowhead matrices,
* all eigenvalues and eigenvectors of rank-one modifications of diagonal matrices (DPR1), and
* all singular values and singular vectors of half-arrowhead matrices.

The last class of matrices typically appears in SVD updating problems.
The algorithms and their analysis are given in the references.

Eigen/singular values are computed in a forward stable manner. Eigen/singular vectors are
computed entry-wise to almost full accuracy, so they are automatically mutually
orthogonal.  The algorithms are based on a shift-and-invert approach.  Only a
single element of the inverse of the shifted matrix eventually needs to
be computed with double the working precision.

The package also contains functions for applications:
* divide-and-conquer function for symmetric tridiagonal eigenvalue problem
* roots of real polynomials with real distinct roots.


## Contents

### Arrowhead and DPR1 Eigenvalues

The file `arrowhead1.jl` contains definitions of types
`SymArrow` (arrowhead) and `SymDPR1`. Full matrices are accessible
with `Matrix(A)`.

The file `arrowhead3.jl` contains:
* functions to generate random symmetric
arrowhead and DPR1 matrices, `GenSymArrow` and `GenSymDPR1`, respectively,
* three functions `inv()` which compute various inverses of `SymArrow`
matrices,
* two functions `bisect()` which compute outer eigenvalues of
`SymArrow` and `SymDPR1` matrices,
* the main computational function `eigen()` which
computes the k-th eigenpair of an ordered unreduced  `SymArrow`,
and
* the driver function `eigen()` which computes all eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of a `SymArrow`.

The file `arrowhead4.jl` contains:
* three functions `inv()` which compute
various inverses of `SymDPR1` matrices,
* the main computational function `eigen()`
which computes the k-th eigenpair of an ordered unreduced `SymDPR1`,
and
* the driver function `eigen()` which computes all eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of a `SymDPR1`.

### Half-arrowhead SVD

The file `arrowhead5.jl` contains definition of type `HalfArrow`. The type is
of the form `[Diagonal(A.D) A.z]` where either
`length(A.z)=length(A.D)`
or `length(A.z)=length(A.D)+1`, thus giving two possible
forms of the SVD rank one update.  

The file `arrowhead6.jl` contains:
* the function `doubledot()`,
* three functions `inv()` which compute
various inverses of `HalfArrow` matrices,
* the main computational function `svd()`
which computes the k-th singular value triplet `u, σ, v` of an ordered
unreduced `HalfArrow`,  and
* the driver function `svd()` which computes all
singular values and vectors of a `HalfArrow`.

### Tridiagonal Divide and Conquer

The file `arrowhead7.jl` contains a simple function `tdc()` which implements
divide-and-conquer method for `SymTridiagonal` matrices by spliting the matrix
in two parts  and connecting the parts via eigenvalue decomposition of
arrowhead matrix.

### Polynomial Roots

The file `arrowhead7.jl` conatains the function `rootsah()` which computes the
roots of `Int32`, `Int64`, `Float32` and `Float64` polynomials with all distinct
real roots. The computation is
forward stable. The program uses `SymArrow` form of companion matrix in
barycentric coordinates and
the corresponding `eigen()` function specially designed for this case.
The file also contains three functions `inv()`. Similarly, the file
`arrowhead8.jl` conatains the function `rootsah()` which computes the
roots of `BigInt` and `BigFloat` polynomials with all distinct real roots.
The file also contains function `rootsWDK()`, an implementation of the
Weierstrass-Durand-Kerner polynomial root finding algorithm.


## Authors and References

The functions for arrowhead and half-arrowhead matrices
were developed and analysed by [Jakovcevic Stor, Barlow and
Slapnicar (2013)][JSB2013]
(see also [arXiv:1302.7203][JSB2013a]).
The routines for DPR1 matrices are described and analysed in [Jakovcevic
Stor, Barlow and Slapnicar (2015)][JSB2015] (the paper is
[freely downloadable](http://authors.elsevier.com/a/1Rmlt5YnCLEdU) until
Nov 15, 2015, see also [arXiv:1405.7537][JSB2015a]). The polynomial root finder is described and analyzed
in [Jakovcevic Stor and Slapnicar (2015)][JS2015].

Double the working precision is implemented by using routines by
[T. J. Dekker (1971)][dekker1971] from the package [DoubleDouble][byrne2014]
by Simon Byrne. This package is not maintained any more and is deprecated in favor of
[DoubleFloats](https://github.com/JuliaMath/DoubleFloats.jl). However,
we are using lightweight and faster implementation in the file `DoubleDouble.jl`
which is now ported to Julia 1.0+.
